Join us for the first monthly live recording of the [Team Human](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/team-human-live-feat-douglas-rushkoff-and-mitch-horowitz-tickets-1095533553349) podcast in its new home at CX, an experimental social club in NYC where I’ve just begun serving as “scholar-in-residence.”

I will be joined by occult historian Mitch Horowitz, to discuss how we humans can reclaim our power and agency in a world overrun by forces and institutions that use our best impulses against us. Are we under a spell, being drawn into a reality that has been designed by those seek to control us? And might magic be the best way to break free?

How can magic, sex, psychedelics, art, and ecstatic experience liberate us from the oppressive narratives of destruction and doom — not just in our hearts and minds, but in the material reality?

There will be plenty of time for audience questions and participation, as well as a book signing and dance party following the show.
