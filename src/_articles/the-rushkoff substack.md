I’m Douglas Rushkoff, and I write and speak about media, technology, and cultural change from a decidedly human and pro-social perspective. I’m trying to put the “social” back into media, as well as into social-ism and society itself. I firmly believe we are in this together.

So, the vast majority of the content on this Substack will be free. This is a way for me to consolidate my journalism, my podcast, my mailing list, my general musings, work-in-progress, and even my social media discussions in one relatively safe space (especially compared with what else is out there).

Anyone can come and read most of the content for free, and click on links to hear any Team Human shows that may be referred to in the posts. Paying subscribers will get exclusive access to:

1. An ad-free feed of the Team Human podcast via the Podcast menu above.
2. The ability to post comments and engage in conversation here. (Only paying subscribers can comment.)
3. Subscriber-only posts, as well as access to work-in-progress and other stuff I wouldn’t post publicly.
4. Free tickets to public events, Team Human Live performances, and talks. (And highly discounted access when that’s not possible.)
5. Direct participation our collective nervous system.
6. More stuff, videos, access to archives, sneak peeks of new writing and graphic novels, unreleased recordings of new talks, and whatever else may be happening.
