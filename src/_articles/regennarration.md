On this new, not-directly-election-related, episode of Team Human, I have a wide-ranging conversation with Australian regeneration doula (my words, not his) Anthony James. He’s trekking American in a tent with his family, making some keen observations on how our society works and doesn’t, while connecting with many of our First Peoples along the way.

We had a great conversation about how regeneration actually happens, and on why doing something isn’t always the best way to allow for systemic healing.

In the introduction, I make a case for leaning into the fear or sadness so that it can transform into something else. When things are going off the rails, sometimes the best strategy is to wait until things change. I also make one last appeal for everyone to vote, even if your candidate doesn’t perfectly express your essence. Voting is a crude tool - instrumental. Whose administration, however compromised by neoliberalism, is more likely to care about nature or human rights, or the people left behind on the earth when Elon Musk’s rockets take his post-human DNA somewhere else.
