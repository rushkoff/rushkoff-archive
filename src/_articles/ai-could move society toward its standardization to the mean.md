My main thought right now is that AI will continue to revert us to the mean. I don't need to explain how AI works here, or its tendency to push things to the probable outcome. I believe it not only works that way in particular responses but in its overall impact. The media environment of AI pushes society towards the mean. This is happening on a personal and political level as well. Our governments are moving toward feudalism and authoritarianism, which is the most common form of government in Western civilization. Similarly, levels of state/national violence, forms of thuggery and mob rule, etc. We have yet to see whether returning to feudalism will be better or worse for the world at large than efforts until now for Enlightenment-based democratic principles, which fell prey to neoliberalism. But it doesn't look so good.
