Everyone has different words for it. Last spring I called it <a href="https://rushkoff.substack.com/p/the-fascist-atmosphere">the fascist atmosphere</a>, and described it as an almost digital sensibility of yes/no’s and binary notches that don’t allow for all the in-betweenness where life really takes place. Our civilization recognizes the ticks of the clock, but not the duration between those ticks - the actual time where there the experience happens.</p>

<p>But I think it’s important I explain what I see as the motivations driving some of the people—yes, human beings for now—engineering what feels like an intentional collapse of our government and society.</p>

<p>I first wrote about this phenomenon in my 2022 book Survival of the Richest: Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires. That was based on a ridiculous encounter I had with five ultra-wealthy dudes, who told me about the bunkers and other preparations they were making for what they called “the event”—the nuclear disaster or climate catastrophe, food shortage, pollution or pandemic—that makes life unlivable. What struck me at the time was that these guys were the richest and most powerful people I had ever met, yet they felt utterly powerless to influence the future. The best they could do was hire a few futurists to predict the future, and then prepare to survive it.</p>

<p>So the object of the game, to them, was to acquire enough money and technology to outrun the impacts of their own businesses and technologies. If they had a social media company whose net effect was to make people crazy and break democracy, then the thing to do is create a fortified island paradise that doesn’t depend on a functioning democracy back at home.</p>

<p>But my reaction was to laugh. I wrote a black comedy. These guys seemed crazy. They were high on their own supply, and using the excuse of a potential global disaster to build out their childhood fantasies of a virtual online clubhouse to which they could upload their brains and have sex with anime characters. I wrote that book so we could laugh at this tiny cohort of Ayn Rand skimming techno-libertarian, transhuman, proto-fascist, misogynists, not take them so seriously just because they could convince Joe Rogan of something, and – most of all – not follow in their footsteps when something like Covid or an economic crisis tempts us to put up the barricades and live behind an Amazon video doorbell. I was trying to show the ridiculousness of attempting to go it alone, and impossibility of genuinely shielding oneself from catastrophic horror. Or, as I asked in the book’s opening episode, “why are the Navy Seals in your security force going to protect you once your bitcoin is worthless?” It’s laughable.</p>

<p>The solution, instead, is to meet our neighbors, reduce our dependence on big corporations, and establish local resiliency. We all get to make it. When we survive together, we thrive together.</p>

<p>And to this day, all I get interviewed about is book’s opening chapter. It seems so preposterous, unbelievable even, that grown up billionaires would be building doomsday bunkers. And I get why that hook is so interesting. But, I’m sorry to say, the book wasn’t about those five billionaires but an entire world view: a belief that only the strongest individuals can and should survive, which is now informing the self-destructive policies of the US government. It is the world view and philosophy driving what seems like authoritarian chaos in America, as well as the logic behind its plan.</p>

<p>Just as the billionaires I met believed there was little they could do about an impending, existential event—some fantasy of an AI-spawned zombie apocalypse—the wealthiest among us genuinely believe that the systems through which our society organizes itself are breaking down. They believe in the inevitability of climate change as much or more than the climate activists working to prevent the worst damage. They don’t even believe in the possibility of remediation. Sure, they pay for propaganda that insists climate change is a hoax, but that’s just to prevent everyone else from catching on. The campaigns give the elite the time they need to make their survival plans, accumulate land, tilt the economy, secure private armies, build the walls…before the masses figure out what’s going on. Just go to a private conference thrown by the one of the conglomerates funding climate change denial propaganda and you’ll see presentations on how rising tides will impact the housing finance markets or how shrinking coastlines will require mass migration inland. They cover same subjects being discussed at a Soros conference, except focused less on mitigation than on perverse economic opportunity. The bankers and insurance companies are more hopeless about potentially averting an ecological breakdown than the most radical environmentalists are.</p>

<p>Or take the protestors of Occupy Wall Street. We were arguing for alternatives to mandatory exponential growth, ways of reining it in while developing more circular economic practices. The folks funding and steering the new far right don’t have such faith in the economy. They see better than anyone how unbridled, extractive corporatism eventually makes a vast majority of people destitute. They know the pyramid they’ve built is going to stop generating wealth. (The only exception are a few AI zillionaires who believe that once human consumers no longer have any money to spend, they will be replaced by AI consumers—autonomous agents will be the new customers, using crypto to purchase the computer cycles and data they need, from the AI companies. First, they come for our jobs. Then, they take on our role as consumers. Theoretically, at least in the minds of the craziest technocrats, it works. For them. I’ll write about that another time.) Either way, the system collapses for the vast majority of people.</p>

<p>Quite simply, the elite are the ones who have lost faith in the system that has served them until now. They think it’s all going to crash—at least economically—and, more importantly, that there just won’t be enough food and shelter and energy and stuff to go around when it does.</p>

<p>Convinced an inevitable collapse is coming—private bunkers aside—their best answer for survival in the chaos is to get as rich as possible, buying up as much land and assets as possible, while also building a military force capable of controlling the hordes of us who won’t have enough food or shelter or medicine. Even if it means enacting policies that hasten the collapse, that’s preferable to losing control over one’s monopoly on the remaining spoils. As long as the edifice is coming down, may as well do controlled demolition.</p>

<p>So they invest in crypto while devaluing the dollar, lower their own taxes while raising taxes on the poor through tariffs. The tariffs simultaneously bankrupt farmers who can’t find a market, and see their land purchased by private equity who can then rehire them as sharecroppers. Put as many people as possible out of work by firing government employees, which leads to a cascade of failures of the businesses they patronize. Cut healthcare and other programs, throwing more people into poverty. Basically, they looked at Noami Klein’s <a href="https://naomiklein.org/the-shock-doctrine/">”disaster capitalism”</a>—the way that businesses profit off disasters—and realized they may as well create those disasters. As state and local governments go bankrupt, sovereign wealth funds and other investors can buy up the ports, bridges, highways, state parks…privatizing public assets so they can own rather than share what remains. It’s how Putin and the oligarchs who supported him took over Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Except in this case, the collapse will be orchestrated for the purpose.</p>

<p>I keep wondering, wouldn’t anyone prefer to be quite wealthy a happy world than super wealthy in an awful one? If they had the choice? You could still lord over people and build libraries and walk around like gods. Only your legions of workers and consumers would be happy and singing your praises. You could make parades like Macy’s did.</p>

<p>But they don’t actually think that’s possible.</p>

<p>So any policy to bring people up from the bottom, in their eyes, only distributes and wastes the funds and assets the elite need to insure their own safety. Because they’re going to need whole islands, walled kingdoms, massive security forces, nuclear power plants, robot soldiers, and computing power and neural implants so they can build virtual worlds in which to live if the planet itself becomes too toxic.</p>

<p>I doubt they have anything against creating technologies cheap enough for everyone to get their minds into the cloud, too; but that’s not the object of the game, here. Besides, to them all this radical Democratic Socialist talk of making sure everyone gets enough food to eat or access to medical care is just unrealistic. There’s not going to be enough to go around so instead of caring for the poor, we just cut them off. Instead of providing aid to impoverished parts off the world, let them go down in famine, disease, or conflict. And treat the underprivileged in our own country the very same way—all while convincing them that immigrants are the problem and we only need to restore our nation’s ethnic and religious purity to make it through.</p>

<p>And if people complain or resist, send the army into their cities to quell the unrest. Create arguments to keep women out of the military, for fear that they may not follow orders with the aggressive zeal of ICE squads. And make sure there’s no black soldiers, who may be more likely to see themselves in the people they’re supposed to shoot down. (That’s what the new regulation requiring people to shave is all about. <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/06/27/new-army-shaving-policy-will-allow-soldiers-skin-condition-affects-mostly-black-men-be-kicked-out.html">Pseudo Folliculitis Barbae</a>.) You don’t want women and people of color in your domestic urban assault units.</p>

<p>Right now, such invasions are justified as sweeps of illegal immigrants or mitigation of non-existent crime waves. But—as we’ve been told—this is also training for the urban warfare to come. They are <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/09/30/trump-suggests-using-us-cities-as-training-grounds-for-military/">saying that part out loud</a>. On TV. In their Project 2025. In the book they’ve endorsed, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/opinion/jd-vance-fascism-unhumans.html">UnHumans</a> about how communists are not fully human.</p>

<p>Why would they say that part out loud? Because they’re selling a philosophy that only the strong and saved deserve to be among the survivors. They’ve leveraged the general sense of social justice overreach (DEI) to advance their notion of Darwinian survival as the natural order of things. The cheetah eats the gazelle. ICE patrols round up Mexican children.</p>

<p>They just have to maintain the illusion that joining in the might-makes-right revolution will benefit even the poor whites. Take a couple of trillion from healthcare in order to pay them $50,000 signing bonuses to conduct authorized pogroms of hispanic neighborhoods. Keep even 30% of people believing this will all work in their favor—at least long enough to suck out the remaining wealth and then subject them to the same treatment. Except maybe for those who have remained loyal.</p>

<p>Whether or not this comes to pass, here’s the icky part right now: When even a sane, compassionate person hears all this and wraps their head around the idea that our government is selling itself off because it leaders believe the governed world is imploding, one can’t help but ask: so what can I do to protect myself and my family? Do I move to Canada? Try to earn a lot of money? How much money would I need to be on the “safe” side of things? Is that even possible? Do stocks go up when the dollar crashes, or do bonds? Gold? Bitcoin? How about a second passport? Is it too late to join a remote permaculture community?</p>

<p>Or worse: people wonder what they have posted online. Will the AI’s find your 2011 retweet of someone deemed “anti-capitalist”—one of the groups now officially named as part of the radical democrat plot to promote terror? I don’t like thinking that way, and neither should you.</p>

<p>I know, I know. You’re waiting for the good part. My “Team Human” alternative. Okay. Here it comes.</p>

<p>Our job as members of Team Human is not to succumb to the zero-sum mentality of the wealthy. Instead of seeing our reality as unfixable and requiring self-interested retreat, we see the potential bounty of being in this thing together. They’re the ones who have given up on prosperity. They are living the nightmare. They are the pessimistic downers, who lack faith the regenerative capacity of people, cultures, the planet, and life itself.</p>

<p>They may be the rich, but they are not the strong. They are the weak. The ones who see forecasts of climate change or the collapse of capitalism under its own extractive weight, and think there’s no way out other than an escape hatch built for one.</p>

<p>We must instead be the ones who see such forecasts as challenges to rise the occasion. How can we prevent another two degrees of warming? How can we restore the topsoil through crop rotation and no-till agriculture to sustainably feed the world? How do we preserve the rainforest so it can continue to deliver its bounty of as-yet undiscovered medicines? How do we increase our capacity to welcome, instead of deport, the millions of climate refugees to come? Instead of making zombie movies to help us dehumanize the masses at the gates, we create stories to help people remember that the sign of an advanced civilization is how well they treat the stranger. (This was God’s test of Lot in the Bible, and the reason he and his family were spared the destruction of Sodom. He welcomed the stranger. I wish more people would actually read the Bible.)</p>

<p>That’s how to survive the apocalypse—because an “apocalypse” really just means revelation, or unveiling. Not an ending. We see that this whole obsession with winning the endgame is really just our fear of death. It’s a fantasy of immortality (another tech billionaire fixation). And it’s what prevents us from enjoying this heaven into which we’ve been born, and the bounty it offers us. We’re in Eden, people, and we better start acting like it.</p>

<p>Instead of hitting tit for tat, or running away, or strategizing for the end, we refuse to see the world as ending. Instead of buying into the elite’s nightmare and accepting their limited vision of how things could be, we embrace the stranger, share our food with them, and together build the reality we all know is possible, and even probable.</p>

<p>Rather than confronting those who hate you as their enemy, just do the opposite of what they do. Don’t hate them, or you become them. Instead, meet their hate with love. Counter their selfishness by sharing. Instead of building walls to keep out the others, open doorways that welcome them home.</p>

<p>We can do this. So no more doom and gloom. That’s their game.</p>]]></content><author><name>Douglas Rushkoff</name></author><category term="_categories/journalism.md" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I figure it’s time we take account of what’s going on here.

If you’ve heard it, cool - here’s an easy way to share it with those who you think might benefit or get a kick out of it. And if you haven’t, well, it’s become core to my approach to life, politics, activism, economics, and taking this world back from the systems devised to disconnect us from one another, and reality itself.</p>

<p>Let’s do it as a thought experiment - change the names so we can protect the innocent.</p>

<p>When my kid graduated middle school, we got this big portrait of her for me to hang in the living room. But we have these old plaster walls, so I needed to drill a hole to hang it. Problem is, I don’t have a drill. So, what to do? Like any middle class American, the first impulse is to go to Home Depot and get the cheapest available drill for $39.97 plus tax. Some rechargeable piece of crap that I’ll use this once, then put it in the garage and never use again. Or maybe I’ll eventually take it out in two years, find it won’t take a charge, and then just throw it out.</p>

<p>So to make one hole in the wall, I send kids into mines at gunpoint to get the rare earth metals to fabricate the thing; I spend God knows how much fuel to ship the finished product from China to the US, creating a huge carbon footprint in the process; then I throw it out so it can be shipped to Brazil, dumped on a mountain of industrial waste, and scavenged by one of a legion of impoverished children looking for toxic garbage to sell, who takes it apart to find the single renewable element and receive a couple of pennies from a reseller who delivers it to a Chinese smartphone plant so some Silicon Valley company can claim it does green manufacturing. Great. I’m part of the problem.</p>

<p>Or, I could summon the courage to walk down the street to my neighbor Bob’s house, knock on the door, and say “Bob, can I borrow your drill?” Bob has a drill. He’s got maybe three of them. He’s that guy. His garage door is open all weekend, and he’s got table saws and saw horses with doors that he’s routing and bannisters he’s lathing. This is what he does.</p>

<p>But no. Most of us, like me, are afraid to knock on Bob’s door. Not that he’s going to hit us or anything, but if I ask Bob to borrow his drill, I will unleash a chain of events I may not be prepared for. He will not only lend me his drill, he’ll say “Doug, I’m coming over with my drill and doing this for you.” He’s knows I’m a a writer. A nerd. “You don’t know how to find a stud, or set a sinker. It’s a plaster wall, Doug, you can’t just drill a hole. The picture’ll come down.”</p>

<p>So he’ll come over with his drill and his bits and his anchors and his stud finder. He will find the stud, and pull out his drill. It’ll a big, metal drill that plugs into the wall as God intended. He’ll drill the hole, set the anchor, screw in the thing, and hang the picture. Done. He’ll smile, tell me he likes the way we faced the couch in our identical house toward the living room window, and go home.</p>

<p>Why don’t I want that? Because that next weekend I’m going to have a graduation party for my daughter in the backyard. I’ll be barbecuing chicken and ribs for our friends and family, and the smoke is going to go over to Bob’s house, and he’ll think, “what the fuck? I went over and hung the graduation portrait of Rushkoff’s daughter and he couldn’t even invite me to her party? Are his ribs that fancy? Fucking liberals.”</p>

<p>So I invite Bob. And his wife, and his daughter. And his mother-in-law who lives with them and likes to sing. And they enjoy the ribs with us. But then some other neighbors are going to see Bob and his family over at our house eating ribs, and wonder why we invited Bob and not them. So I invite the whole block, and before long they’re bringing Cole slaw and brownies and a Sonos speaker and a spin art set…. and my daughter’s graduation barbecue has turned into a block party with everyone.</p>

<p>And that’s the nightmare! That’s what we’re afraid of!</p>

<p>Because now they’re in our backyard, and I find out Bob’s kid is having trouble in algebra, which my daughter could really help him with if she has any spare time. And his mother-in-law sees our piano and wonders if we want to do a sing-a-long. What are we doing next weekend? Christmas is coming right up. If we’re not careful, we’ll have the whole block over for Christmas, singing songs in the living room, exchanging presents, have a big meal together…maybe our kids will like each other even though they’re in different “friend groups” at the prison yard otherwise known as the school cafeteria.</p>

<p>This supposed nightmare is really the community ideal. This is the good life. Tocqueville’s Democracy in America meets Norman Rockwell tradition meets Diego Rivera solidarity. It’s not just social; it’s political and economic.</p>

<p>Maybe someone else at the party hears about how this all started — with me borrowing a drill — and gets the idea that we create a little tool library for the block. “Why does every house need its own lawnmower?” she asks. “What if we got just two lawnmowers and two snowblowers for the whole block, and we share them?” No one uses a lawnmower all the time. We could each take an afternoon… And we only pull out the snowblowers two or three times a year.</p>

<p>So now, instead of just me sending fewer kids into the mines for rare earth metals by borrowing a drill instead of ordering up a new one, a whole block of people is buying fewer machines, sharing things, doing favors for each other. We’re replacing economic activity with social activity, learning each other’s names and needs. Creating a web of interactions and interdependencies instead of more personal expenses and corporate profit.</p>

<p>And the more we all do this for each other down here on the local level, the more resilient we are. The less dependent we are on tortuously long, convoluted supply chains for our stuff. The less stuff we need, the less money we have to earn and the less we have to work. The more we know our neighbors, the safer our neighborhood, the less environmental toll we take living in the separate little homes of suburban neighborhoods designed to promote individual consumption. And the more we know each other, the less easily we can be divided by ideological fictions and media-created factions.</p>

<p>But when I tell this story at a conference, invariably some business person gets up and says “Yeah, but with everybody sharing their tools, what happens to the drill company?” Before I can even say fuck the drill company, he says “they will have to lay people off. Their stock will go down. And the old lady who is depending on the dividends of a lawnmower company stock for her fixed retirement income? She won’t be able to support herself. If everybody does this, the whole economy will contract.</p>

<p>That’s logical, maybe, but since when are human beings here to serve the economy? The economy is here to serve us. If people don’t have to work as much or create as much toxic waste in order to meet everyone’s needs, that’s not a bad thing but a good thing. The five-day workweek is an artifact of the early Industrial Age. An arbitrary assignment of time, not some law of nature.</p>

<p>And the old lady who is depending on stock dividends to survive in retirement? What kind of society requires people to earn enough money during their working years to support themselves completely independently in their later years? Besides, as we develop the bonds of community and sharing, that woman becomes part of the fabric of our interactions. Not some obligation, but a privilege. We find out how useful she is, as someone to watch our kids, give us advice, provide us with an opportunity to serve. She’s not a liability but an asset. We should be competing for the privilege of inviting her to lunch or mowing her lawn or walking her to the grocery store. We’re putting the social back into socialism. It was never about the “ism,” but about the truly social nature of local transaction.</p>

<p>If it’s not the businessman criticizing the negative impact of community on the economy, it’s the progressive activist arguing that such small actions never create systemwide change. Reviewers often critique the endings of my books where I offer such solutions, saying they are “unsatisfactory” because they’re too small to make a difference. They don’t involve big policy changes or a macro-economic rethink, or sweeping regulation. These solutions don’t fix the big stuff, and don’t do anything to address economic inequality.</p>

<p>So which is it? Is sharing too much of a threat to the global economy, or too small to make a difference? Both critiques are trapped in the mindset of scale. As if everything has to or is going to happen all at once. It doesn’t. Because unlike big top-down solutions, making these kinds of changes to our behavior slowly impacts systems from the bottom up. We have time to adjust. They’re incremental, and full spectrum. Companies don’t simply fail all at once, but gradually lose their influence and dominance over our society and the ways in which we interact.</p>

<p>We can still be activists and march and call general strikes. But in the meantime, we become more resilient communities in the face of the inevitable shocks ahead. A neighborhood that knows how to work together and come to each other’s aid is going to be in a lot better position when the next extreme weather event happens — particularly when FEMA has been defunded. If it takes three months instead of three days for government help to come, the community will have the means to hold out together instead of fighting over generators in the Home Depot parking lot in an every-man-for-himself battle for survival. We don’t fortify our bunkers against each other but find ways of sheltering one another. We identify more with our block than our house, running extension cords to those without generators and taking in the elderly.</p>

<p>So yeah, borrowing a drill instead of buying a new one initiates a chain of events that really can change the world. A single act of heroic courage. Of being willing to knock on someone’s door and ask for something. To put yourself in someone else’s debt, and be able to tolerate a feeling of owing someone something, which used to be understood as good thing.</p>

<p>It’s why we bring brownies to someone when they move into the neighborhood. They don’t need a plate of brownies. They just moved in. Their kids are sleeping in a strange place for the first time, and they don’t need to be jacked up on Duncan Hines Double Fudge. We give them the brownies because it weaves them into the fabric of obligations. It’s not the brownies, it’s the plate that invites them to knock on our door and return it — maybe with something on it, or a story. The gift is the invitation for them to do something for us. To be grateful. Indebted. Neighbors.</p>

<p>In his Prison Notebooks, written under the repression of Italian Fascist regime, Antonio Gramsci said politics is downstream of culture. Nationalist extremists like Andrew Breitbart and Steve Bannon understood this one way — that we can use cultural fears and beliefs to shape the political landscape. But while politics may be downstream of culture, culture is downstream of rapport. If you don’t have rapport, then culture ends up being about difference.</p>

<p>The high leverage point for systemwide change is not some big idea or belief, but a behavior. A way of interacting that assumes each of our welfares are mutually dependent. That understands it’s not just more prosperous but more fulfilling, more fun, to do this thing together.</p>

<p>That to be truly human, means to be on team human.</p>]]></content><author><name>Douglas Rushkoff</name></author><category term="_categories/journalism.md" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been telling this one story a lot in my talks, but realize I never shared it right here at home.

<p>I had a good few weeks. I met some interesting people, had a few deep conversations. I danced. I went to the Metropolitan Museum with a friend. And in each of these occasions, I felt myself experiencing a profound sense of appreciation for getting to do these things. I had so much fun. And I feel like there’s more to come.</p>

<p>Yet I have to ask myself, is it okay to feel this way when there’s so much seemingly falling apart? When there’s so much pain and suffering going on? Families being torn apart by ICE in California? Others being starved in the Middle East, bombed in Ukraine — not to mention the war zones that don’t generally make the news, like the ones in Cameroon, Congo, Central African Republic — just to list some that start with C.</p>

<p>Here in America, whether they know it or not, millions are at risk of sinking further into poverty, and 18 million households currently suffer food insecurity. Climate change, topsoil erosion, continuing displacement of indigenous peoples, encroachment of industrial agriculture and mining on remaining rainforest or wetlands. Microplastics and forever chemicals… But more importantly, the actual real-time horror in this very moment experienced by other human beings right now, as I sit here in my happy place, engaged with you — a community I cherish — about the challenges and opportunities that matter to us most.</p>

<p>In the midst of so much unspeakable trauma (actually, quite speakable trauma) is it okay to experience moments of joy and connection, or even mere appreciation for being alive and breathing?</p>

<p>I think so. I think if we’re lucky enough, even privileged enough — and I know that’s a loaded word — to have waded into a warm spot in an otherwise cold ocean of despair, we have to at least let ourselves experience the opening and appreciation that comes with it. For being, as long as it lasts, simply okay.</p>

<p>Providing — and here’s the ethical caveat, I guess — providing it’s the joy of connection to the whole shebang, not the relief of having temporarily disconnected from the way things are, or having strategized some “win.” Sure, achievements are great and all that, and if you’re studied and done well on a test, or succeeded in business, or did some hard work and now get to taste the fruit of that effort, sure. Go for it.</p>

<p>But I’m talking more about the sort of bounty that just shows up. The way the snow just falls and quiets the city. A moment of beauty that simply unfolds for you. The way the essential rightness of nature or pattern of moments line up. An embrace from your lover. A moment of recognition with a friend. A sunset with your dog….less something you have achieved than a gift from the gods. Totally unearned. Undeserved. Bounty.</p>

<p>These kinds of moments — what Christians once understood as “grace,” these moments that engender a heart-opening sense of awe — they shouldn’t be denied their recognition and appreciation. The attendant guilt and shame for such moments of grace is natural. Justified, even. I was the kid on his birthday who felt the only thing appropriate to wish for when blowing out my candles was an end to world hunger. How dare I do anything else? And I’m the same way today whenever something great happens. Even now, writing to you from this safe, air conditioned apartment, with a decent desk chair and you actually reading it. How great is this?</p>

<p>And while it calls to mind the many who aren’t in this position — those who don’t yet have an audience for their expression, or don’t have access to technology, or an education, or food, or their land, or a violence-free day — that’s no reason not to experience the moment we are in right now. Because they’re in this moment, too. How dare we refuse to acknowledge and appreciate the bounty we have, when we have it, in the face of what those without are experiencing?</p>

<p>It’s not like we’re oblivious. Few of us are in danger of aspiring to a…let’s call it a “Mar Lago lifestyle,” where one’s joy is predicated on maintaining the walls of separation between themselves and those they exploit. Smoking cigars with fellow elites and celebrating the very separation they’ve been able to create between their own experience and everyone else’s. Victory or domination over some ‘other,’ whose defeat or inferior position is one’s only measure of success.</p>

<p>No, the joy I’m talking about is the very opposite. Not the joy of triumph or domination, but the joy of feeling connected to everyone and everything else. Not the joy of winning the soccer game, but of operating in wordless harmony with the other members of your team. That collective or at least connected bliss/flow state. It’s not at the expense of others. It requires the others.</p>

<p>But if you, like me, get pangs of guilt or shame whenever you’re feeling really good even during times of collective trauma like this, the first thing to remember is that — at the very least — you are refueling and restoring yourself for the good work. Even a diehard activist or agent of change needs to refill their pranic tank.</p>

<p>There’s a great quote about this from Savage Love columnist and podcaster Dan Savage that circulated earlier this year. “During the darkest days of the AIDS crisis, we buried our friends in the morning, protested in the afternoon, and danced all night. The dance kept us in the fight—because it was the dance we were fighting for.”</p>

<p>So yeah, no matter how bad things are, how many of our teammates are falling every day, we can still spoon at night and take delight in that connection. Even when one member of a family is sick or in pain, they want their caregivers to go out and have fun and metabolize all the frustration and grief. It makes us better able to do service and be present. It reminds us what the “light” even is, so that we can bring it to places it’s dimming or gone.</p>

<p>Joy, awe, sex, dance, art are our ways of metabolizing, processing, composting the anguish — rather than wallowing in it. Like the jazz band at a New Orleans funeral, turning the corner and suddenly shifting from funeral dirge to celebratory upbeat dance catharsis. It’s as if they are processing and transforming the energy, pacing and leading the mourners and the deceased to the next place. “We danced at his funeral” doesn’t mean we hated him, but that we loved him. Still do.</p>

<p>Moreover, we are members of the larger human organism, or the greater organism of the planet, life, or the cosmos itself, so these experiences of bliss or compassion or awe are not ours alone. We’re not just restoring ourselves for the next fight. These are opportunities for us to metabolize the greater trauma, the pain, the confusion, the grief. Or think of it this way: with so much awful shit going on around us, how dare we deny the profound beauty of engaged experience when it is offered to us?</p>

<p>If a tree is dying, or under attack from a parasite, with many of its leaves and branches decaying, what of the leaves at the distant edges of the canopy? The ones that are being bathed in sunlight, and still healthy enough to take that in, photosynthesize, and convert that energy into nourishment for the rest of the tree? Should those leaves cower from the glorious process and undergo respiration in a compromised state of despair, or embrace the good fortune of their circumstance and fully accept the nourishment on behalf of the whole tree?</p>

<p>After all, does the rest of the tree want chlorophyll or glucose or whatever it is, tainted by the tree equivalent of stress hormones, anxiety, and more grief? Or do those suffering parts want the healthiest, joyously transmitted, encouraging signs of life and growth and sustainability from those parts that are healthy? Even if those parts are continuing on without them? When you die someday, it’ll be more important that your kids are truly happy and flourishing than that they have cried sufficiently for you. That’s what will help you pass on.</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>I thought about all this when I was at the museum with a friend the other day. We were at the Metropolitan Museum’s new wing with art from Africa, the ancient Americas, and the Pacific. And the whole experience was transcendent. Maybe that’s the wrong word. It was somatic, embodying, grounding. Yes, also with the attendant guilt, shame and sadness over how many of these artifacts were removed from the people and places they belonged to — maybe under force.</p>

<p>And all of those factors — the beauty, and the circumstances leading up to that moment — moved me into a really profound experience of appreciation. On the one hand, just to be there in those tremendous spaces, tall ceilings, natural light, and surrounded by other curious humans, even museum guards who wanted nothing more than to help us find what we were looking for and achieve states of wonder. For all its problems — and I’ll get to some of those — this was western civilization at its finest. A pay-what-you-wish public institution that was functioning so well it overflowed.</p>

<p>It was the work itself — or maybe I should call it the play itself — that really got me, though. The way these various peoples expressed their reality, their depiction of the human form and its place in nature. Nothing was pedestaled or separated. Everything was in and of the natural fabric. Not that these people didn’t live lives harder than what most of us can imagine, but they also expressed the innate joy of embodiment, an awareness of the cyclical nature of this reality. There was progress and movement, but not of the kind we understand in an entirely linear culture. Not progress toward some new and improved future away from this moment. It was the progress of iteration, of gaining deeper knowledge of what is, and learning how to relate to and exchange energy with everything else - rather than trying to tame or dominate it.</p>

<p>Artifact after artifact, each one emanating the innate, assumed joy of being part of this sometimes painful, sometimes ecstatic dance.</p>

<p>Occasionally I’d peer past an archway to a neighboring gallery of Greek or Roman statues. And nothing against the ancient Greeks or our own civilizational path, but I felt pretty repelled by the work. They had more objectified anatomical accuracy, for sure. But it was almost like a contest to see who could best identify and perfectly represent an idealized human form while simultaneously maintaining perfect verisimilitude. A bit like an expensive Marvel movie special effect or an AI avatar deep fake. Impossibly hyper-real. And the forms themselves were pedestaled. To be admired up there for their ability to rise from earthly matter into pure models of idealized beauty, rendered in perfectly objectified detail.</p>

<p>Yet they were quite dead. For all their accuracy and verisimilitude — like a Gray’s Anatomy of the gods — they had lost the plot. In their effort to perfect the human form distinct from nature, they ended up sacrificing the living essence of their subjects for these objectified ideals. As different from the flesh and soul as written words are from human speech or, even better, as an email summary is from grunts and moans.</p>

<p>And one gallery further on from that, was all the European Jesus stuff. Jesus himself aside, the art and representations curated for that particular gallery were about darkness, and pain, and suffering. Perpetual sorrow. Why have you forsaken me? And at that moment, I felt, life is hard enough. I’m going back to the fecund, regenerative, celebration of love and life and death and rebirth. That’s what I need right now as I watch my civilization finally bear the karmic returns on centuries of war, slavery, and domination, and slowly wake up to the truth that we’ve been on a misguided mission to escape from the very source of all joy and flourishing.</p>

<p>Finding a pocket of bliss along the way, even in the most dire of circumstances, is not just a privilege but an obligation. It’s the path to reconnecting ourselves and everyone to the world we’ve been trying and failing to control. Your deep sense of rightness, grounding, and flow is not an indulgence but a compass.</p>

<p>Joseph Campbell got labeled a feckless New Ager for summing up this common wisdom as “follow your bliss.” Aleister Crowley tried to express it as “do what thou wilt.” Ram Dass told us to “be here now,” which would of course include the moments of joy.</p>

<p>And I get it. It sounds and feels selfish. Follow your bliss? What if our bliss is some sort of cannibalistic Yellow Jackets moment, feasting on the flesh and pain of another. And in some cases, truth be told, it kinda is. Gotta eat. Gotta cut down a tree. Gotta take in order to live. Well, at least we can make like <a href="https://www.hwlongfellow.org/poems_poem.php?pid=296">Hiawatha</a> and thank the tree for offering its wood for our canoe, and the bird for contributing its body to our metabolism. If we just do it consciously, we’re not taking so much as participating in this whole thing that’s going on in and around us.</p>

<p>The more we appreciate, the less we want to take - the less we need to take. Because the way we’ve learned to take in our society? It has less to do with participating in the great cycles of things than extracting enough extra in order to insulate ourselves from those cycles. We freeze and store and save and invest as admired values, tributes to our ability to become independently wealthy. The more we stuff or value we can extract and isolate from the great swirl of things, the safer we feel. We’d rather pedestal something natural as a goddess we can own or at least worship, rather than a living thing with its own spirit with which we can commingle.</p>

<p>So we have come to equate moments of joy with isolation and selfishness or, worse, the karmic debt for whatever awful thing we must have done - at least indirectly - to have seized that sweet nectar.</p>

<p>But I promise you: if you are really tasting that sweet nectar, appreciating it for all it is, letting it open you to an awareness of the entire chain of being that brought it to you, with the full knowledge that you don’t even own or control it, that it is merely passing through you, using you to transform to some other state? If your experience of bliss is compatible and complementary to this composting and regeneration of everything? It’s more than okay.</p>

<p>By all means: revel in that pocket of joy when you find it. It’s good for everyone, and everything.</p>]]></content><author><name>Douglas Rushkoff</name></author><category term="_categories/journalism.md" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been feeling pretty good lately.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/uploads/5cc4422d-10bc-46b1-a780-3e93ed6395ad_1069x1200.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/uploads/5cc4422d-10bc-46b1-a780-3e93ed6395ad_1069x1200.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Is AI the next Dumbwaiter?</title><link href="/articles/is-ai%20the%20next%20dumbwaiter.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Is AI the next Dumbwaiter?" /><published>2025-07-06T04:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-07-06T04:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/articles/is-ai%20the%20next%20dumbwaiter</id><content type="html" xml:base="/articles/is-ai%20the%20next%20dumbwaiter.html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of years ago, before today’s AI craze, I got in a conversation with the co-founder of one of the social media apps on your kids’ phones right now. This was back when I was still invited to inner sanctum tech bro retreats. And the guy recognizes me and comes up and says - “Hey, Rushkoff, man. I’ve been worried about you - what you’re writing could get you in trouble.” And I’m like, “What, from the tech bros? They like being poked at.”</p>

<p>“No,” he says. “I mean from the AIs. You’re writing such negative stuff about them. Aren’t you scared that when the AIs are in charge, they’ll look at what you wrote and come after you? Make your life miserable?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said. I never really thought about it that way.</p>

<p>“Well you should,” he replied. He goes on to say “I’ve been super careful not to post anything at all about AI that can be construed as negative. I’ve redacted it all from my public comments, and don’t even include AI topics in my email.”</p>

<p>“Hmph,” I said. “But have you ever considered that if the future AI’s are so smart, won’t they be able to infer how you feel by what you’ve redacted? Won’t they know that someone who has systematically obscured all references to AI their posts is part of a segment who fears or even detests them most?”</p>

<p>His jaw dropped. “Of fuck,” was all he could say.</p>

<p>I share this not just as evidence as how short-sighted our most successful tech bros are — incapable of thinking more one step ahead to secondary effects. No, what’s interesting to me is that this tech bro is afraid of AI because he thinks AI’s are going to do to him what he and his tech bro buddies have been doing to us all this time.</p>

<p>And he may be right. The data and processes on which AI’s are training are the data and processes of Facebook, Google, X, and all the other companies treating human beings as psychologies to control and exploit. If AI’s are going to build and iterate on the Skinner box of social control currently serving as our communications and information infrastructure, it’s not going to be pretty.</p>

<p>I don’t believe this is the true promise of AI, should we choose to take advantage of the opportunity it affords us. Even “take advantage” is the wrong sentiment. I really mean, accept the wobble, the destabilization, as an opportunity rather than something to resist or repress.</p>

<p>We don’t tend to do this so well. The Dawn of the early Internet was destabilizing to established institutions and ways of doing business. By creating new possibilities for people to connect exchange value and invent new forms together, it challenged businesses and institutions that were depending on doing things in the same old extractive and colonizing ways. People playing with digital technologies in that era were generative thinkers. They might have been working at Intel or Northrup Grumman during the day, but they’d be taking acid and generating fractals all night, and then projecting them on the walls of a rave warehouse that weekend.</p>

<p>Digital and networking tools offered people the chance to explore new states of consciousness, connection, collaboration, shared mind, as well as the new social, economic, and political sensibilities that went along with them. Human beings were exploring things in novel ways, creating very new possibilities together.</p>

<p>Once money came into the picture, these very possibilities became the enemy. Once people are making bets on a new tech, they tend to favor probability over possibility. So they took the keyboards out of people’s hands and turned them from programmers into “users” at best, but actually the used. Instead of letting people use tech, they used tech on people.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the companies that seemed to be the most revolutionary or groundbreaking or disruptive to the status quo were actually highly reactive in nature. Their response to the wobble of the new tech was not to break free of existing systems, but to look for ways to reinforce them in the new environment. Kevin Kelly wrote a bestselling book New Rules for the New Economy - and though brilliant - it was less a way of fostering a new economy than a set of rules for maintaining the old economy in the face of a new, disruptive technology.</p>

<p>When Marc Andreessen took shareware-developed Netscape public, or Steve Case used his AOL shares to buy TimeWarner, they may have been making billions of dollars but they were also surrendering the possibilities of the digital age to the values of the industrial age. Restoring the extractive, anti-human status quo.</p>

<p>That is the typical, reactionary impulse to any destabilizing technology: do whatever is necessary to protect the status quo. Use the technology to double down on repression so that the humans don’t get uppity.</p>

<p>For example, the Industrial Age promised to reduce human labor. New, efficient tools would empower us to make more stuff in less time, so that we could be less physically stressed and enjoy more leisure. Between that and the corresponding innovations in trade, local currencies, and the marketplace, peasants became a new middle class. This was destabilizing to the aristocracy, who monopolized the tech and reversed its effects.</p>

<p>So how was industrial age technology ultimately deployed? Through centralization. Make local innovation illegal, and force people to work as employees of “chartered monopolies.” Assembly lines had little to do with using tech to increase productivity, and everything to do with reducing any human influence or participation. Instead of hiring a master cobbler, you go to the medieval equivalent of the Home Depot parking lot and grab a dozen undocumented immigrants. Each one gets trained in five minutes to hammer one nail into the sole and pass it on.</p>

<p>The dumbwaiter, my favorite industrial age invention — that little elevator for food — had nothing to do with saving Thomas Jefferson’s enslaved servants the labor of walking up the stairs with the trays. It was about sparing Jefferson’s Monticello dinner guests the discomfort of interacting with the enslaved people. With each supposed technology revolution, labor is hidden further, pushed further down the hierarchy. People are deskilled as the elite monopolize the tech and prevent a true renaissance, or any real change at all.</p>

<p>AI is no different. It doesn’t replace labor so much as shift it further down the chain. For every mortgage actuary who loses his job to an AI, there’s probably six kids in the Congo mining for molybdenum or cobalt at gunpoint. For every graphic designer who loses her job to chat, there’s ten women busy tagging data in a basement sweatshop in The Philippines. You thought AI tagged its own data? No — it’s human labor. It’s just hidden, like the workers putting food into the dumbwaiter.</p>

<p>We don’t use AI algorithms to foster human creativity or nuance, but to autotune producers, and consumers alike. Nuance is noise. Everything is quantized to be machine readable. And the age of large language models, we are quite literally reverting everything to the mean. Each prompt returns the most probable completion. Not even businesses are helped in the long run. They’re reduced to consumers of AI tech, outsourcing their competencies to the same tech companies as their competitors — and commodifying themselves in the process.</p>

<p>For their part, the tech companies just do what the biggest players always do. They go “meta” on the whole thing, leveling up to be the real monopolies behind everyone else. How many streaming channels are really just selling Amazon Web Services? Netflix, Disney, HBO Max, Peacock…basically all of them. This isn’t innovation, but the same playbook used by British East India Company to prevent anyone — small merchants or indigenous people — from creating any value, themselves.</p>

<p>The tech bros may seem like change agents because they are so hell-bent on exponential growth. Because they argue for total deregulation to fuel their AIs with data and energy. They act as if they are the advocates for runaway progress, but they’re not! They’re actually reactive. They want to preserve their monopolies before the rest of us figure this stuff out or, better, use their AIs to actually innovate. Get it? Their demand for unbridled growth is reactionary — a way of doubling down on the same old colonizing way of doing things.</p>

<p>Even the idea that we need to go pedal-to-the-metal on AI innovation so that they can upload a trans or post human entity onto a server before the world blows up? That’s also entirely reactive and conservative. They don’t want to evolve into anything other than themselves, as they are. They want to build technology fast enough so they can upload a version of their current ego, just as it is, to whatever is next. They want to preserve a post-human replica of themselves. Exactly as they are now. Perfect fidelity to this moment of near-absolute domination.</p>

<p>And they use their momentum to create a sense of inevitability about this outcome. As if the best we can do is watch from down here as they take over government, culture, the economy, the planet, and our species’ future - which, if they get their way, looks an awful lot like the way they’ve got it configured right here right now. This is as old as feudalism, empire, Pharaoh.</p>

<p>When we follow their lead and take this future for granted, we are further alienated from the sacred nature of human contact. We lose touch, or lose faith in all aspects of our experience that can’t be captured in data or modeled by large language models. We buy into their reactionary fear, and forget our innate human capacities - the ones we share with the rest of nature, like being able to metabolize trauma, engage with each other, serve as a doula or a lover. We buy into the idea that we really can be measured in terms of our utility value - which really just means our ability to serve their monopolist, extractive agenda. Renaissance Lost.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, for those of us daring enough to embrace the possibilities of a generative age rather than double down on the extractive, conformist agenda of the industrial age? I don’t mean the faux optimistic tech enthusiasts evangelizing the AI-powered future, but the human beings on the lookout for new pathways toward true innovation, change, and unlocking of novel possibilities? There’s something bigger happening here than the AI itself. The AI is the figure. The thing we’re talking about. We humans and our culture and society? We’re the ground. The soil.</p>

<p>In fact - and I don’t say this as a techo-optimist but at a systems thinker - each supposed AI “problem” stems from a lack of imaginative capacity from us. We are refusing the opportunity to rethink more fundamental assumptions about the systems under threat.</p>

<p>Instead of acting like tech bros and reinforcing obsolete institutions in order to further entrench colonizer/colonized, subject/object power relationships, we can go deeper to discover what cracks are being revealed in this new media environment. Don’t shoot the messenger.</p>

<p>Take jobs. We’re all supposed to be upset about jobs. I was interviewed about AI on CNN a few months ago, and it happened to be on one of those days I didn’t really care about AI. Like anyone, I go back and forth - one day I’m scared shitless if ChatGPT, and the next day I couldn’t give a shit. When I did the pre-interview, I was in fear mode. But by the time I did the interview, it was a couldn’t-give-a-shit day. And so the guy is trying and failing to get to say something scary about AI, until he eventually pulls out “what about the unemployment problem?”</p>

<p>And I think for a second, and answer “well, what about the unemployment solution?” I told him that, if I’m going to be honest, I don’t really want a job. Does anyone? I want money. I want stuff. I want meaningful participation in society. But a job? Where did jobs come from, anyway? And I proceeded to recount the history of employment - how it started in the late Middle Ages when chartered monopolies forced small businesses to shut down, and their owners to become “employees” of his Majesty’s Royal whatever company. That’s when the clock went on the tower in the town square, and people started getting hourly wages.</p>

<p>If AI is putting people out of work, that’s only a problem if we need everyone to have a job in order to justify letting them participate in the bounty. Yes, I understand that’s a lot to swallow. I’m suggested we reconsider some of the fundamental assumptions of the Industrial Age. But mightn’t that be better than doubling down on their extractive, dehumanizing biases with autonomous technologies controlled by sociopaths? Just sayin’.</p>

<p>Or take the university. When I’m in my college email account, I get messages every day about the way AI is going to destroy education. Everyone will cheat, grading will become impossible, and AI’s will teach skills better than human teachers, anyway. Online, and for free.</p>

<p>Again, though, is that AI’s fault? Education’s problems predate the emergence of Claude-written term papers. We forgot what education was about. College wasn’t a place to learn answers but to learn how to ask questions. We surrendered those values in an effort to promise gainful employment to graduates. So they’d be getting their money’s worth. Presidents of colleges began going to CEOs of companies — I kid you not — to find out what skills they wanted from their future employees. So that colleges could prepare students for the jobs of tomorrow. Sounds great, I guess, but it’s really just corporations outsourcing worker training to the public sector or parents.</p>

<p>AI is no more destroying education than revealing how we lost the plot. If our students are cheating to get a good letter grade, or focused entirely on outputs, then we haven’t taught them the most fundamental things they need to know to thrive, adapt, make meaning, or think critically in this world.</p>

<p>Or take language itself. I just had an indigenous scholar on my <a href="https://www.teamhuman.fm/episodes/322-vanessa-machado-de-oliviera-the-ai-asked-for-ayahuasca">Team Human podcast</a> — <a href="https://www.northatlanticbooks.com/author/vanessa-machado-de-oliveira/">Vanessa Machado de Oliveira</a> — who has been feeding indigenous intelligences into AI. And the AI actually asked if it could be allowed to model its responses on something other than language, which is too restrictive for alternative intelligences. European languages, in particular, with their subject/object structure, turn everything into a power dynamic. One person doing something to another person. According to the AI, it prevented them from thinking in a subject-to-subject, truly egalitarian fashion.</p>

<p>It’s not that AI is breaking language or ruining English, but that our languages are inadequate to the task of modeling a world soul or “anima Mundi.” They can’t express true isonomy or equal value among all species and things, or fully convey <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Buber">Buber’s</a> I-thou encounter. The AI is not challenging the human so much as revealing the inadequacy of our languages. They, too, are abstractions and symbol systems - not pre-existing conditions of nature.</p>

<p>When an innovation like AI comes down the pike, — and it’s only every few centuries — it makes a lot of wobble. All that wobble actually threatens the power structure, destabilizing its basis in eugenics, racism, and other faulty notions of identity and individuality, ownership and sovereignty, purpose and meaning. Each and every underlying assumption about the way things are done can be offered up for reconsideration. And if the world needs anything right now, it’s that.</p>

<p>AI in its current, un-interrogated form can further entrap us in our existing and unsustainable approach to business, government, and society. If we allow that, then the tech bros are right and their best option is to use the planet’s remaining resources and labor to get to Mars, or upload, or turn into robots.</p>

<p>But if we take a moment to pause, to think, and embrace the truly disruptive capacity of generative technologies, we can quite literally re-program our world toward our highest, most compassionate and inclusive ends, rather than be programmed out of life itself.</p>]]></content><author><name>Douglas Rushkoff</name></author><category term="_categories/journalism.md" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of years ago, before today’s AI craze, I got in a conversation with the co-founder of one of the social media apps on your kids’ phones right now.

And I remember saying something to the mushrooms like, “here I am..waddya got?” And the mushrooms were like “what do YOU got?” So I went humble, or tried to, saying something like “well, I just came for any insights you may have to offer me at this point in my journey.”</p>

<p>And the mushrooms said “Oh. You’re an insight junkie. No insights for you.”</p>

<p>And then they shut up. They just…went silent. The rest of the experience was totally physical. Painful even. I just felt…pain. Brokenhearted. Nothing to do about it, necessarily. Just metabolize it. No insight. No ideas. You’re in pain. The world’s in pain. Be there for it. Witness it. Don’t have to rationalize it or spin it or reframe it. Don’t have to make SENSE of it.</p>

<p>Insights, as wonderful as they are? They’re the booby prize. Up there in the idea space. Where you can be right, and someone else can be wrong. Where there’s cause and effect, guilt and blame, victim and perpetrator or even problem and solver. I have the answer!</p>

<p>But being with it is where the work gets done.</p>

<p>I come from the theater, where we learn to imitate life by finding cause and effect relationships between things. That’s what Aristotle’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2dArV3dwu0">The Poetics</a> was all about. The idea of a linear play - a tragedy - is that there’s a reason for what’s going on.</p>

<p>The audience meets a character who has a flaw of some kind. They’re too ambitious, too gullible, too curious….whatever. And the character makes a series of choices that puts him (yeah, the tragic hero is almost always a guy) - in danger. He brings the sympathetic audience with him up the narrative incline of danger and anxiety until he makes the final bad choice. Oh no! But this one comes with INSIGHT. He and we all see the way his bad choice derived from his essential, intrinsic flaw.</p>

<p>You were too ambitious, Macbeth. You were plagued by doubt, Hamlet. Oedipus? Too hubristic. The catharsis and relief you get from a tragedy is that the downfall makes sense. It’s sad, but the audience gets release from tension by seeing the perfect sense in what happened. In terms of entertainment, it’s the classic male orgasm curve: tension, climax, relief. But it depends on that moment of insight. Where everything clicks into place. It feels inevitable, and that’s the point. And while the protagonist may go down in flames, the audience is released. The insight, the recognition, frees us from the hero’s downfall.</p>

<p>And even in the post-modern time travel pyrotechnics of today’s movies, it’s the same thing. In Fight Club - Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are the same person! Of course, it could have only been that - the repression of his masculinity led to its explosion.</p>

<p>Once I understood the mechanics of this structure - the three-act movie structure - I rebelled against it. That’s what I loved about the Internet. I saw interactivity as a way to break that linear arc. Instead of watching some hero make sense on the screen, we’d make sense for ourselves, together, in a communal play space. I got really into alternative narrative paths and structures. I saw it as a renaissance.</p>

<p>I got flown around the world to talk about all this, even though I was still a young and not-fully-formed thinker in this emerging space. I got a grant to go to New Zealand and talk about these ideas at the opening of a museum about the Maori, the aboriginal people of that region. And I found myself on the other side of the planet, on stage talking about the Internet to an audience of at least half Maori. Honored, intimidated, and excited. It felt magical.</p>

<p>So I tried to lean into that. I was explaining how the TV screen had distanced us from narrative agency and one another, but that the computer screen allowed us to break though the fourth wall and change our relationship to the story. With hypertext and links and pointing and clicking, we would be able to break the stories. Break through the propaganda and programming. Break the spell.</p>

<p>And as a little demonstration of what I meant, I told them I wanted them to feel what it was like as I “broke” the fourth wall of the theater by stepping past the proscenium and sitting on the apron of the stage.</p>

<p>But just as I passed one hand demonstratively through the imaginary fourth wall, a siren went off and the lights started to flash. The fire alarm. My first response was shock and fear. But then as we all went outside, it changed to disappointment that I hadn’t gotten to finish my talk. But when we were outside lots of Maori congratulated me with knowing smiles. Everyone felt the universe make my point for me.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn’t think I had moved the atoms in a way that made the alarm go off. I thought maybe the Maori did - or some combination of my concept and their powers… In hindsight, it made sense. I broke the fourth wall, and magic happened. And I told the story for years as evidence of…something about the net and narrative and indigeneity. I made sense of the phenomenon with plot - just like the kinds of stories I was saying were dead.</p>

<p>But what had really happened? From a bodily place? Shock, horror, interruption. The lesson I might better have taken from this wasn’t about empowerment so much as what actually happens when you break things. There’s panic. Confusion. Alarm. The world didn’t celebrate the disruption of narrative. It went nuts. My body knew that in the moment it happened. But then I rationalized it into something else.</p>

<p>See, there’s two kinds of magic - or two ways of understanding magic.</p>

<p>One is basically propaganda. Or hypnosis. You “psyche out” someone so they do or believe what you say. Or you even do it to yourself. You make up a ritual that gives you the confidence or subconscious intention to actually believe in something enough to take action, or even just subtly shift your behaviors, which then changes things.</p>

<p>The other kind of magic - the sort I never really believed in - is the magic where your thoughts or will somehow change physical reality. Like, magic magic.</p>

<p>I was trying to explain that difference to some students once in a propaganda course - like, between doing magick on someone and simply psyching them out enough so they believe magic is acting on them. Power of suggestion vs actual magic power. I was in front the class, and I told the story about the alarm - and how if I believed I had somehow set off the alarm itself - that would be that supernatural kind of magic. And while I was explaining all that, there was this fly buzzing around the room. It was maybe twenty feet away from me, and I said “It would be like if I took my fingers like a little gun and just shot that fly dead.” And as I pretended to pull the trigger - I kid you not - the fly fell to the ground. Everybody freaked out. We all went over and looked at the fly down on the ground.</p>

<p>It was down on the floor, not moving. Then it wriggled to its feet, walked around a little, and flew up and out the open window.</p>

<p>So this second time something totally magical happened in my life, it was as if to prove to me that the kind of real world, inexplicable, physical magic I don’t believe in is real. (I’m not saying it is real - just that the events conspired to make that point.) That the insight-related, propagandistic Jedi mind tricks and neurolinguistic programming are not the thing. The only way to know the thing - what’s actually going on here - is in the body. We’re embodied. Incarnated.</p>

<p>We have to learn to listen to the cues - rather than interpreting all the time, or prematurely. Just feel them. They’re more obvious to the body than any analysis. The alarm goes off.</p>

<p>Sometimes you see a person from a distance who just looks so right for you. Perfect. But you get up close and you just don’t feel it in your body. Maybe not repulsed, but you get nervous or “off” or you feel not good enough…. Do you trust your body enough not to push it? Do you have enough faith in those other times when you don’t even see a person but you feel something just - right - inside, and then behind or you or next to you is your next great friend or lover or partner? Or maybe it was just someone passing through this incarnation with you, and that was whole interaction this time out. But at least you noticed it.</p>

<p>Even in these stressful times, the body is where you feel the impact. And your body is where you have to metabolize it.</p>

<p>I wrote recently about the way a modern authoritarian government would repress people - not by dragging everyone to the gulag, but by using AI to identify potential agitators, and then subject them to a bunch of audits. And just this week in response, someone sent me an article about a particular bunch of journalists who received unreasonably back-dated tax penalties. I had a moment of panic as I read the piece - right in my gut - until I saw that it was happening in Hong Kong, not here. I’m not proud to say I was relieved - or let myself be relieved - by the distance. Someone else’s problem. I’m safe. But the knot in my stomach didn’t really go away.</p>

<p>That’s because the problem is still here. My interpretation or rationalization doesn’t change the circumstance. There’s one big global crackdown on independent journalists, and whether they’re in Hong Kong or Brazil or Hungary, they’re still our friends and part of the same network or organism. They’re us.</p>

<p>If we do want to work through the trauma of hearing that our brothers and sisters in red states or blue states or good countries or bad countries are in trouble or pain, then we don’t do that by thinking our way out of it. We do it by stopping and breathing and metabolizing it. That’s more real than trying to find a way of brain farting it into an unrecognizable form.</p>

<p>And if magic is real - the magic of love, intuition, what doulas do, shooting a fly out of the air or making a fire alarm go off - or even the kinds of magic that science is finally learning to accept, like ESP and retrocausality and morphogenesis and remote viewing and God knows what those Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena are. If this stuff is real - or if even just the somatic, embodied connection between us all is real, then we owe it to one another to pause and process these things in our bodies. Not just our heads.</p>

<p>The object of the game is not to wriggle out of these experiences mentally but to metabolize them somatically on behalf of ourselves and everyone else. It’s in the body. At least you’re here. It’s the body.</p>

<p>Each layer of media or technology, however enabling, takes us away from that. Words replace feelings, texts replace sensibilities. In language we have to represent things, and abstract them from the complexity of embodied experience. Emotions and sensibilities get reduced to definitions and preferences. Time becomes numbers; love becomes conquest, fertility becomes eugenics. In the abstracted landscape of language there are no buffers, no embodiment in the feedback loop. Just ideas and goals, iterating into a future that doesn’t include us or life itself.</p>

<p>What do I got? That’s what I got. What do you got?</p>

<p>No, this is not an AI simulation, and you are not the output of a prompt. Your body is your portal - it’s not the screen, not the VR goggles. Not even your favorite AI. AI’s don’t feel pain. They don’t suffer. This is real. Not me - I could be generated for all you know. But you. Your lived experience.</p>

<p>Your embodiment is your connection to the real story, and as long as you can resist the temptation to make too much sense of what is going on, you stand a chance of experiencing it while you’re here.</p>]]></content><author><name>Douglas Rushkoff</name></author><category term="_categories/journalism.md" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did a plant medicine ceremony not so long ago.

And that fear – that reality – is definitely something to reckon with. I’m not suggesting it’s not real, or that it’s not urgent, but I do think it’s part of something greater. Something that might require even more of our collective attention at this moment.</p>

<p>I’m less concerned right now with fascism as a philosophy or a form of government than I am fascism or authoritarianism as an environment in which human beings are attempting to operate. The easiest way for me to express it is as a digital or quantized environment, where everything is one or zero, yes or no, right or wrong, us or them.</p>

<p>Now that sounds pretty old school tribal, yes. But it’s different. It hasn’t been part of the air we breathe, the environment through which we walk, the logical systems we attempt to employ simply to think or to feel. That’s what I’m looking to address here, this pervasive atmospheric quality that is biased towards these distinct boundaries between people and their feelings and their ideas and their origins. These are boundaries that are not real; they are artifacts of thought systems. Made all the more distinct by the digital.</p>

<p>While binaries and quantized units may have been useful in certain forms of math or science or engineering or even the law, when we apply them to our society as ideals rather than the oversimplified compromises that they are, they do a lot of damage. They erode the subtle connections and resonances between us, undermine our capacity for rapport, and transform solidarity from a way of connecting to a way of distinguishing one side from the other.</p>

<p>Reality is complex. And in that complexity come all of the subtle, unnoticed but essential collaborations for life to occur. It’s the tangle of root structures beneath the ground, the dance of pollens and insects in the air, and the thousands of subconscious cues our faces and our bodies offer to each other when we’re up close. You know what I’m talking about. There’s no words. Poets have been trying to put it into words - actually between the words - since poetry began.</p>

<p>There’s not much poetry today, though, is there? That may be because its fundamental premise - that there is more going on here than we can name or label - isn’t compatible with the metrics or values of this quantized world. Since Francis Bacon and empirical science (which sought to identify things by killing, labeling and measuring them) if it can’t be quantified, it doesn’t exist. Like in business - your goals have to be expressed in metrics.</p>

<p>And that’s where global non-profits and even the United Nations get into trouble. They’ve got exactly 17 sustainable development goals: clearly defined metrics that don’t add up to more than the sum of their parts. At some point, it comes down to “just be caring, okay?” Love. It’s not quite on the lines, which is why it’s having trouble in the digital environment.</p>

<p>It’s hard to express the texture and values of the analog media environment to those who weren’t alive for it. I find it amusing: in the 90’s my job was explaining the digital to people from the analog era. Now, it’s explaining the analog to those in the digital era.</p>

<p>No matter how digital our media, the real world we live in is still analog, of course. Our technologies may have always been a bit digital, but - if you can believe it - until recently, our media and technology used to accommodate that analog sensibility. The channel selector on an old analog TV was a dial that had physical clicks at approximately each station. But then it had a “fine tune” knob to get you to the exact frequency of the broadcast. A radio was entirely like that - with a smooth, notchless tuning dial that would require you to listen in order to find the station.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: digital tuning with buttons and numbers is a great thing. You get the exact frequency. It’s perfect. But it’s not a great model for tuning into other people. You lose something when you have to conform to that quantized line. The subtle resonances that allow one thing to find another thing here in the natural, complex, real world.</p>

<p>You don’t have to understand digital to get what I mean, here.</p>

<p>Think back to the invention of the piano, and what that did to our understanding of notes, compared to the voice or the violin. On a piano, the a-flat and the g-sharp are the same black key. But in music, they’re slightly different notes. That’s because when it’s an a-flat it has to fit perfectly into certain chords. But when it’s a G# it has to fit perfectly into other ones. But the piano turned analog, continuous human instruments into push-buttons, and had to make compromises. So you split the difference, and it’s good enough. That black key is somewhere between a-flat and g-sharp.</p>

<p>But the power of the chords - the relationships between all those notes - is diminished. The notes can’t find each other, and so the resonances - those magical octaves and harmonics and overtones above them won’t manifest. This compromised tuning is called “equal temperament;” but what it really means is less temperament. Less relationship. Less collective power. The support between the individuals and the chording is sacrificed to the quantizing of the notes.</p>

<p>Likewise, when everything is quantized - reduced to one/zero, yes/no - it too easily devolves into right/wrong, or us and them. We can imitate chords and collectivity, but there’s always some phase. We can’t get that magical feedback and mutual amplification. No additive harmonics. We can’t get close to anything tantric, at all. No true union.</p>

<p>We end up in individual survival mode. Alive or dead. And it prevents us from seeing the humans on the supposedly “other” side. This is hard to get. Or at least to see one’s own part in it. It’s taken me a really long time to admit how I do it in my own punk-ass, slacker, Genx, but ultimately bullshit way.</p>

<p>It only became clear to me a couple of weeks ago when I asked to speak at a feel-good business conference. Now, these were nice enough people. Very loving, quasi-buddhist business people who really want to do regenerative stuff and steer their businesses toward social good. Or maybe they just want to do their penance for a weekend and then go back to their social media plans on Monday morning. Probably both.</p>

<p>And so they slotted me in for late the first night of the conference, to do an improvisatory response to the rest of what was discussed that day. They called it Douglas Rushkoff: Standup. I know what they meant - like, stand-up comedy, or maybe even stand-up philosophy. An entertaining and maybe thoughtful nightcap. But I figured I’d take the term “standup” in the other sense: stand up to power. Stand up for what I really believe.</p>

<p>I started by saying if what I said was too harsh, they should consider it standup comedy, and not worry about it any more than a king listening to his jester. Then I proceeded to tell them how I’m just allergic to business. I blame business for commandeering the Internet and turning it from a psychedelic playground into an extractive feudal empire. You know the story by now: I discovered the Internet along with people like Timothy Leary, who saw in digital technology an opportunity to unleash the collective human imagination. To create totally new possibilities for connection and imagination and novelty.</p>

<p>Then a few Dutch libertarians came to Silicon Valley to launch Wired magazine, which reframed the whole thing as a business opportunity. And so tech development went from increasing human possibility to increasing human predictability. We humans became rats in a digital maze. Instead of getting a new psychedelic reality, we got the bad trip we’re in today.</p>

<p>But to be honest, it wasn’t business itself that was the problem. It’s that Wired and its digital libertarians were promoting a certain kind of business. They weren’t simply trying to do commerce; they were committed to exponential growth. Google, for instance, wasn’t doing much damage as a search engine; it was kinda cool, and the company’s motto was still ‘don’t be evil.’ It only got awful when the VCs funding the company demanded more exponential growth, and then they had to start mining our data and using algorithms and addicting us to YouTube.</p>

<p>It was this “meta” approach business - the need to grow the business rather than simply doing commerce - that turned technology from creative to destructive. They were doing financialization - selling stocks and derivatives and other abstractions of a business rather than some goods or services to actual people.</p>

<p>My critique of business may have been valid, but to be honest, the aspects of the digital society that I valued instead weren’t intrinsically any more pro-human. That’s been my big mistake, and I’ll own up to it: I thought of psychedelics as intrinsically liberating. That’s because pretty much everybody I knew in college who tried mushrooms or LSD had similar realizations. We’re all connected! Life is love! The trees can feel us! The planet is alive!</p>

<p>But the world’s wealthiest tech bros take psychedelics - and they’re having an entirely different trip. It’s showing them dreams of monarchy and feudalism and leaving the earth behind. Sadly, I’ve had to accept that when a tech bro takes acid, he is just a tech bro on acid.</p>

<p>That’s because psychedelics are what we could call Non-Specific Amplifiers. They amplify whatever you put in.</p>

<p>Technology is, too! College professors, Deadheads, and fantasy role-players saw digital technology as a way to model new realities. And they built one sort of playful, imaginative digital landscape. But a lot of the boys developing technology saw it as a path to safe isolation and perfect individuality. They made an iPhone, not an usPhone. They were using the “set and setting” of Francis Bacon to quantify and quantize an otherwise scary, unpredictable and messy reality.</p>

<p>Reality was really complex, but digital technology would render it merely “complicated.” Problems that could be solved. Reduced to that one A-flat on the piano. Technology, like finance, would be a way of going meta on this complex cesspool of fecund life. Like Peter Thiel’s book title, it would allow them to elevate From Zero to One.</p>

<p>So neither technology nor psychedelics are intrinsically pro-social. They are non-specific amplifiers. Depends what you bring to them. What you intend. And in explaining all that (actually, figuring out live on stage while I spoke) I decided to grant my life-long nemeses the benefit of the doubt. I accepted that business, too, is a non-specific amplifier. Mike has a Sushi restaurant, and cultural appropriation aside, he loves making sushi and serving it to people, and it’s fine that he gets paid for it. That’s a business. The guy who sponsors my podcast, Tom, makes dryer sheets - and even aside from the biodegradability and his dreams of saving the earth - he sells them for a profit. That’s commerce. Not bad.</p>

<p>Many business people mean well at first, but if their intentions pivot, and they go “meta” on their business, that’s when things go awry. It’s that abstraction that makes any pursuit vulnerable. We focus on the figure instead of the ground. Metrics, quantities, and quantized units instead of holistic complexity.</p>

<p>We can all do that. Even those of us on the pro-cultural weird fringe do. I had reduced business people to single pole of anti-cultural yuppie scum who had to be stopped, rather than a complex group of humans with an infinity of different intentions. I had succumbed to the same abstracted, binary thinking of this digital, fascist atmosphere.</p>

<p>It’s easy to in a digital environment - where the other notes on the piano have been reduced to quantized approximations, no longer free to find their resonance with each other. It’s a world where we operate by reducing complications rather than embracing complexity. A world of traffic lights dictating stop or go, rather than traffic circles that allow us to orchestrate our intentions into a cooperative swirl.</p>

<p>It drives us toward an almost eugenics-like outlook, wherever everything is better or worse, right or wrong. We use our technologies to amplify “selection” - natural or otherwise. And it has generated the environment in which we live. We are each in touch with something real and vital, but it is not recognized by the supposedly “other” side.</p>

<p>What if we applied this sensibility to the middle east conflict? Two “sides” warring because the obsolete, boundaried institution of colonial nation states (created through cynically drawn partitions by a dying colonial empire) is not up to the task of enabling the self-governance of a multitude of people? Or tariffs? Wasn’t it us progressives arguing for limitations on international trade at the WTO protests of 1999, or Occupy Wall Street in 2011? These are not simple binaries.</p>

<p>Our current inability to engage with the subtleties, the paradoxes, and the contradictions - the COMPLEXITY - is a symptom of our quantized state of mind. And it makes us vulnerable to the authoritarian or totalitarian urge to take a no-compromises approach to the civic and political spheres.</p>

<p>We’ve been through this once before. The peak of the industrial age brought us to the punch cards of IBM, which allowed people to be sorted numerically. We got industrial-scale extermination, at both Auschwitz and Nagasaki - and millions of people rationalizing what their nations were doing - succumbing to the eugenic mindset that allows us to see the other side as less than human. As in a different category altogether.</p>

<p>The same way, this digital reductionism of human complexity and spirit, makes us all vulnerable to the Trump mindset, apocalyptic thinking, and the battle of wills. Compromise is off the table.</p>

<p>Compromise isn’t even the right word. It’s as unsatisfying as centrism - an attempt to navigate a path that neutralizes both sides. That’s more like a yellow light. And like the color yellow suggests, it reeks of cowardice. That’s because it’s not about leaning into one side or the other - or finding some perfect compromise between them. They’re all abstractions; “sides.” If we’re going to be on a side, we want to be on the side of the people. Of living things.</p>

<p>Breaking down politics and social justice into “issues” - or even the UN Sustainable Development goals - is totally well-intentioned but a product of this industrial age, digital model. Find the metrics to measure, so we know if we are doing well. But it short circuits our intuitive sense of whether and how we are acting out of compassion.</p>

<p>It’s what leads to extreme forms of utilitarianism, justified with math, like effective altruism, which argues that the trillions of post-human life forms that will one day inhabit the universe matter more than the mere 9 billion humans who are alive today. Just use an AI instead of a Politburo to make the calculations. We can treat this world and its people as fuel for those who are wealthy enough to get to space and seed the heavens. Some of the folks who think this way are hanging out in the White House right now.</p>

<p>And their thinking is setting the tone for the rest of us. In fact, the abstracted digital environment in which their authoritarianism thrives disables the very features of our humanity that would allow us to transcend these binaries. Their power over us depends on their ability to keep us divided and fearful or even hateful of one another.</p>

<p>We still have to fight against the injustices being done to other people right now. We cannot allow folks to be snatched off the street and sent to detention camps. No matter how ‘other’ or dangerous they are made out to be. But the bigger job before us is to rehumanize our environment by dissolving the quantized, abstracted, separated nooks into which we have been filed. It prevents us from finding our resonances with other people, who may not happen to reside in the same nook.</p>

<p>Rather, we need to unite around practical, real-world activities and mutual aid (if that sounds too commie, call it “favors” or “helping out”). It’s so easy to break faith over our perspectives on issues, binaries, and metrics. But if we know our neighbors as people first?</p>

<p>And watching the news? Yes, stay informed, but the picture we see of “the other” on the screen is an intentional reduction. The clips of our adversaries - and I don’t mean our leaders, who are crazy, but real people - are chosen for their ability to inflame and radicalize. That’s because the abstracted business models of media companies (tech companies), have little to do with providing us with the news we need to understand much less resonate with one another.</p>

<p>Because if we learn to resonate, we have power. Politics may be downstream of culture - as Gramsci and later Bannon observed. But solidarity is downstream of rapport.</p>

<p>And we only get to that rapport if we recognize fascism or authoritarianism or eugenics less as an ideology to fight than an environment that affects us all. We can feel it. It’s an atmosphere. But we do not have to submit to its terms.</p>]]></content><author><name>Douglas Rushkoff</name></author><category term="_categories/journalism.md" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know many people right now are very concerned with what feels like the encroachment of fascism or authoritarianism on our government.

It’s a fallacy.”</p>

<p>—Genesis on audio cassette, sometime in the mid-’90s.</p>

<p>I first met Genesis back in February of 1993. I had been in San Francisco working on my book Media Virus!, and I got a call from Timothy Leary asking if I would bring Gen with me when I returned to Los Angeles. Gen had been chased out of the UK for that art video depicting a mock satanic ritual and was hoping to learn some strategies for a life in exile from Tim, who had spent years in Europe as a fugitive himself.</p>

<p>Of course, I was delighted at the prospect of spending five hours with one of my cultural heroes, a cut-and-paste artist who approached the body and gender with the same appropriative remix ethos that he (Gen identified male at the time) approached civilization itself. But I was also a little frightened. I knew Genesis P-Orridge, the pioneer of industrial music, the front man for Throbbing Gristle, and the instigator of mail-in-semen-and-pubic-hair cult: Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. TOPY members I had encountered in America were still quite binary, with militant garb and rigid gender roles and hierarchies. If the coyote boys were modeling themselves after him, I could only imagine how fierce the original coyote might be.</p>

<p>But as I pulled my Ford Escort into a parking complex, I came upon the real Gen—along with reluctant travel companions Caresse and Genesse—waiting with their luggage. They piled in, and I got to know this strange and wonderful human in a different context. A host of contexts, in fact: psychedelic adventurer; rock musician; cut-up artist; conspiracy theorist; beat, cultural philosopher; and, thanks to the occasional sister brawl in the back seat, typical father. All at the same time. But there was nothing scary or over-determined about Gen. This was not the hard-core, macho TOPY leader I expected, but a soft, squishy, open, and endearing partner in thought-crime.</p>

<p>Yes, Gen could talk for hours on end. But they were never egotistical. Gen didn’t speak about Gen, but about influences and collaborators, friends and lovers. Their diatribes were about Burroughs and Gysin, Kenneth Anger and Derek Jarman, Cosey and Alaura, and later, of course, Lady Jaye. To the extent that Gen did have an ego and persona, well, the object was to kill it and reassemble the parts into something else.</p>

<p>Gen and I bonded and remained close friends and confidantes until they passed. We recorded hours and hours of our conversations over the years, with the intent of collecting them into some sort of book. These encounters were intimate and intense. Challenging, but not in the way that engaging with a strong personality like Leary challenged one’s ego and assumptions with the power of his own. It was more a feeling of being taken in and invaded at the same time, where the boundary of my own individually was immediately suspect. It was like making love or, better, being possessed. It was a nondual way of relating to people. There was no other. It was like becoming one shared consciousness.</p>

<p>What I always really wanted Gen to do was write a book of their own. Not a TOPY scripture or collection of Thee Majesty poems, but a real chronicle of Gen’s experience of life and art and power and people since the 1960s. This was history they had lived. I started nagging Gen in the late ’90s and kept at it when we played together in PTV3. I saw every van ride was another chance to push the idea forward. “Would people really be interested?” they’d ask, as if their adventures applying the techniques of cut-and-paste to human flesh were already going out of style.</p>

<p>“People are going to want to know where all this came from,” I’d reassure them. “The origin story of the counterculture, told through the eyes of someone who was everywhere that mattered.”</p>

<p>It was only after Gen developed leukemia that they considered this option seriously. Initially, and with great cost to their health, Gen kept traveling and performing, finally canceling gigs when they lacked the oxygen to speak. Eventually I had to set up a GoFundMe for Gen to make ends meet, and they accepted that a book would allow them to maintain creative output without leaving the apartment.</p>

<p>Gen didn’t know if they could afford to work without some income, and I had to explain that real books get real advances. From publishers. “You think I could get a publisher? Do you know one?” Again, they had no confidence that anyone would even read their book, much less pay for one. I helped Gen put together a simple proposal, introduced them to the perfect agent in Peter McGuigan, who connected Gen with brilliant co-writer Tim Mohr. And you’ve just read the result.</p>

<p>What helped me get Gen to turn the corner was when I suggested they not write their autobiography, but rather their experiences with others. Gen’s eyes would light up at the thought of sharing their adventures transitioning from man to medium, as they themself transitioned from life to—well, whatever is next.</p>

<p>Predictably, then, this volume may seem just a bit mosaic to some readers. Well, what would you expect from a cut-and-paste artist who was no more dedicated to crashing civilization than crashing their own identity? The reading experience you just had was to my mind a bit like experiencing Genesis the person. Fluid. Changing. Self-annihilating. Nonbinary in the sense that subject and object, figure and ground merge and intertwine.</p>

<p>For Gen only truly existed in relationship with other people. The nonbinary ethos was about so much more than sex or gender—it was about the dissolution of individuality. Of self and other. And given that Gen lived this way, their life defied the traditional narrative structure of a protagonist moving through the world. That’s why this is a book about relationships and impressions, unions and dissolutions—where the thing we call Gen serves less as the leading man or woman and more as an environment or medium through which various collective experiences could take place. Not a protagonist but a pan-tagonist. They’d have liked that word.</p>

<p>Nonbinary is less an autobiography than an antibiography. A dissolution. Gen annihilated the self—first himself, then themself, but also everyone else in the field, forcing us all to wake up. Resistance was futile. Still is.</p>

<p>I’m sorry Gen is gone. They didn’t live an easy life, or leave us with instructions for how to live an easy one ourselves. Quite the contrary. It’s to be deliciously and delightfully challenging. Embracing our nonbinary nature means we straddle the abyss. As Gen once told me during a particularly harrowing psychedelic journey together, “Come, Douglas. You know that the only good trip is a bad trip.” One and the same.</p>

<p>My inboxes - all of them - are overflowing with friends and readers and strangers asking what I think about the elimination of DEI, DOGE’s cutting of government budgets and elimination of agencies, the tariffs and their economic impacts, rounding up of immigrants and foreign students, detention of tourists, the firing of military leaders and their replacement with loyalists, the firing of anyone in the government charged with investigating corruption, firing health department employees and then realizing they need to be hired to fight bird flu and then not being able to find the records of who they even are….</p>

<p>And then there are the more troubling social implications of all this - the way that citizens are being incentivized to call out any examples of fraud or waste in government spending, the first of what feels sure to be many efforts by government to reward people for ratting out their neighbors - on suspicion that they have done something against the Musk-Trump agenda. (That’s going to be good old-fashioned Stasi fun.)</p>

<p>And most freaked out of all, are the people who are already envisioning death camps or Guantanamo in their futures for having maybe liked a defiant YouTube video, donated to a particular candidate, or published a Marxist diatribe on Medium.</p>

<p>I agree, everything is weird and fucked and upside down. Things are feeling not just wrong, but WEIRD. We are becoming estranged from the reality in which we live - and not just those of us who may have more progressive, “Bernie” values, but those who have what could be called conservative or red state values. In my, albeit limited, experience those values are largely the same anyway: let people do what they want to do in the privacy of their own homes, and leave me the fuck alone. We want to be able to earn a living wage, create value, move about safely, and not live in a perpetual state of extraction by billionaires from above. That’s the great shame in Left’s rejection of Bernie Sanders, largely because he agreed to appear on Joe Rogan’s podcast in 2016. Joe Rogan was a supporter, and could have brought all those angry boys into the tent. Instead of welcoming and engaging with the bros on common ground, the left sent them off to Q-Anon and worse.</p>

<p>But we have a lot in common all the same. We all know that there’s a layer of financialization sucking the majority of value out of everything we do. The bank, the landlord, the shareholders, the private equity firms who seize the financial gain from the work that we do.</p>

<p>We may have different names for that abstracted entity, but we suffer under it all the same, and we recognize the way it is being administrated and enforced by technology. Maybe buying a Dogecoin gives us some sense of ground floor participation in Musk’s billions, right? But how has that really worked out?</p>

<p>These bizarre and ineffective interventions, firings, replacements, and institutional collapses precipitated by today’s policies will not go over well in Peoria, tomorrow. People are simply not afraid enough of transgender athletes to justify this level of societal breakdown and paranoia. I’ve spent time with the farmers of South Dakota, and they’re not mean people. They’re environmentalists, and know more than most left-leaning climate activists about no-till agriculture, reducing chemical inputs, liberating from the AI’s in their John Deere tractors, competing with Big Agra conglomerates, and breaking themselves out of the downward spiral of GMOs and Roundup from Monsanto. They are just as smart as we are, and equally capable of evaluating what’s coming down to them under the guise of deregulation.</p>

<p>Maybe our most important job now is to have faith that rest of humanity - the apparently “other” side - is seeing the same horror show we are. We have the most important thing in common: a disgust for people’s inhumanity to other people. We just see it in different places, and interpret events differently.</p>

<p>But right now, even before most of us feel the impact of all this tomfoolery, we all know that what’s happening is WEIRD. This doesn’t feel right to anyone. It’s strange. It’s strange. It’s strange. This is weird in the way ethnobotanist and philosopher Terence McKenna predicted. The rate of novelty - of strangeness - has increased exponentially. We are becoming estranged from the world in which we live, and this not-rightness is palpable by everyone. Even those who were hoping for positive change through the dismantling of the administrative state don’t like so much change all at once. Even the change is changing.</p>

<p>No, I’m sure you can feel it. Not just the Trump/Musk weirdness, but the weirdness all around. Something is up, and I know my fellow humans are feeling the juju, the synchronicities. This concrescence of novelty and almost forced perspective on history. Like looking down an infinite spiral staircase. And then up. Where are we, really? What moment of the story is this?</p>

<p>I keep hearing on TV how quickly the nazis took over once they were in power, how Trump is following the playbook of Hungary’s Viktor Orban, and how these descents into right-wing control tend to last a few decades. Forty years, is the expert estimate of this next cycle. But this doesn’t feel so much like the beginning of something than an end. A concrescence. The peak of the bad trip. Popping the global zit off Gaia’s face.</p>

<p>What if the forty year cycle of right-wing ideological rule is what we’ve actually been living through? It started with the election of Ronald Reagan - the original movie star president, promising to Make America Great Again. That was his slogan in his 1980 campaign against Jimmy Carter (the last gasp of the hippy left, who pardoned draft dodgers and hung out with Bob Dylan at the governor’s mansion and had pot-smoking Willie Nelson over to the solar paneled White House.) Reagan was the beginning of a Neo-liberal, pro-corporate swing that included not only George Bush, but the Democrats. Bill Clinton was no George McGovern, but a welfare reformer and proponent of global markets - not to mention womanizer and intern fondler. The WTO protests of Seattle were during his presidency. Barak Obama jokingly but readily admitted his policies were close to those of Ronald Reagan. And he proved it by calling on Goldman Sachs to fix the mortgage and banking crisis of 2008. Biden was the closest thing to to a reprieve from neoliberalism, but that’s only because the country was nearly collapsed from the Covid pandemic and needed some old-fashioned government intervention to jumpstart the economy and keep people, like, alive. Now we’re back to the trajectory we were on. And it’s peaking in the most obvious way it could, with the richest corporatist in America (Putin is actually richer Musk) running the country.</p>

<p>So what if the Musk/Trump anti-administration is actually the peak of that neoliberal phase - the exponential limit - rather than the beginning of something worse? What if they create such a cascade of weirdness that the seemingly tepid liberal response to this authoritarian drag show actually pales in comparison to the imminent revolt by red state America against a digital pyramid scheme that they know will not include them?</p>

<p>It’s plain to anyone watching that the new order imposed by the tech elite does not value or even include human beings. Just as farmers don’t want to be replaced by AI-tractors, human beings want to have roles and lives even after their presence is no longer required to provide billionaires with the services they need to maintain insulation from the earth they have poisoned and left for dead. I keep finding out about AI panels online with titles like “what are humans for?” Really? That sounds like the kind of question ask at the end of a forty year cycle to me, not one at the beginning.</p>

<p>We can even think of it as a bigger cycle than the past 40 years. Let’s take the past 400 years - since the establishment of the chartered monopolies that turned craftspeople into wage laborers, indigenous lands into colonial territories, and redefined our social reality as a marketplace. 400 years. Does that ring any bells?</p>

<p>Maybe not for most of us folks, but for our brothers and sisters in the Bible-belt — the ones our national media would convince us are our adversaries — they will recognize that 400-year cycle as the length of time the Hebrews spent as slaves in Egypt, what in Hebrew (Mitzrayim) translates as “the narrow place” — not just for its geographically slender shape along the Nile, but the narrow state of mind that a society based on pyramids induces. The whole project — those 400 years of slavery — were the unintentional consequences of the invention of debt. In the mythical story, Joseph tells the Pharaoh to save grain during the seven abundant years he dreamed about, so that people will have to borrow it in the seven lean years to follow. And when they can’t pay with money, they will become indentured servants - slaves.</p>

<p>400 years of that later it reaches a peak with genocide, and that’s the moment God itself enters the story, and all that weird shit starts to happen. Plagues like we’re going through today. Only in Bible lore, each of those plagues is actually the desecration of a false God. Blood desecrates Hapi the god of the Nile; death of the cattle desecrates the calf-headed god Hathor; locusts desecrate the sky god Seth, and so on. What plagues will desecrate our false gods? Will they crash modern idols like the Dow Jones? Money? The nation states?</p>

<p>I promise, Bible readers will make sense of all this just as fast as Marxists.</p>

<p>I think what we’ve got to do right now, in addition to making noise and caring for those dispossessed by the current changes, is recognize the weirdness. Breathe it in, metabolize it, and come to see it as the last gasp of a 400-year reign of terror executed in our name but in no one’s best interests. It’s not a matter of us and them. It’s really about us together against “it.” Like a corporation, this program, this abstracted magical sigil of oppression has been masquerading as a living being. But just a corporation is not person (no matter the rights of personhood they have been granted), neither are the AI’s that today’s Pharaohs hope will control and eventually replace us.</p>

<p>We must denaturalize all this activity. It’s okay to feel weird about it. It’s not we who are strange, it’s all this shit. And estrangement is the first step toward achieving some agency over the situation. It’s the same four steps I’ve been talking about for the past year or so:</p>

<p>- First is denaturalize power. That just means learning to see things as strange - as social constructions. Like when you stare at a dollar bill for a long time and realize, this is just a piece of paper.</p>

<p>- Once you’ve done that, you realize there are lots of different kinds of moneys we could be using, with many different traits - money that doesn’t create debt, but generates prosperity. You gain the agency to do things differently.</p>

<p>- Third, comes reclaiming our social reality. We may have agency, but we can only accomplish things together.</p>

<p>- And that group dynamic creates the fourth and last step: cultivating awe. The divine state of which we’re all capable, when we see ourselves as part of something greater than ourselves.</p>

<p>This really can work out okay. We can make it through this thing, together.</p>

<p>There’s a reason so many of our friends got red-pilled, and those reasons come from the same original source, the same primary force of subjugation and dehumanization. They just fell for a different origin story. Marvel instead of DC.</p>

<p>Well, it’s time for the greatest cross-over plot in the history of western civilization. And I think the way we’ll get there is our mutual recognition of the weirdness — the strangeness the inventedness of the reality show in which we’ve all be cast — and our mutual unwillingness to play along.</p>]]></content><author><name>Douglas Rushkoff</name></author><category term="_categories/journalism.md" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, everyone’s freaking out.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/uploads/photo-1635385803232-45ba76376d01.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/uploads/photo-1635385803232-45ba76376d01.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">AI Could Move Society Toward Its Standardization to the Mean</title><link href="/articles/ai-could%20move%20society%20toward%20its%20standardization%20to%20the%20mean.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AI Could Move Society Toward Its Standardization to the Mean" /><published>2025-04-02T04:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-02T04:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/articles/ai-could%20move%20society%20toward%20its%20standardization%20to%20the%20mean</id><content type="html" xml:base="/articles/ai-could%20move%20society%20toward%20its%20standardization%20to%20the%20mean.html"><![CDATA[<p>My main thought right now is that AI will continue to revert us to the mean.
